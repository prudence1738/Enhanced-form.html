# Enhanced-form.html
Advanced HTML5: Enhanced Content &amp; Form Demonstration


This repository contains a single HTML file (`enhanced-form.html`) created as part of the Web Technologies July 2025 classroom assignment.

## Overview
The project demonstrates the use of **advanced HTML5 features** including:

- Lists: Ordered and unordered lists for structured content.
- Tables: Organized data with `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and captions.
- Media: Embedded images, audio, and video using semantic HTML5 tags.
- Forms: A fully functional HTML5 form with multiple input types and built-in validation attributes.

## Features
- **HTML5 Validation**: Uses attributes like `required`, `minlength`, `pattern`, `type`, etc., to enforce correct input without JavaScript.
- **Accessibility**: Proper use of labels, fieldsets, and alt text.
- **Semantic Structure**: Sections, headers, and captions for clarity.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `enhanced-form.html` in a web browser.
3. Interact with the lists, tables, media, and form.
4. Test HTML5 validation by submitting the form with different inputs.

## Notes
- The audio file used is a short sample (or your chosen legal music file).
- The image file can be replaced with any local or online image.
- No JavaScript is used; all validation relies on HTML5 native features.
