# Advanced HTML5 - Enhanced Content & Forms

This repository contains a single HTML file (`enhanced-form.html`) created as part of the Web Technologies July 2025 classroom assignment.

## Overview
The project demonstrates the use of **advanced HTML5 features** including:

- Lists: Ordered, unordered, and description lists for structured content.
- Tables: Accessible tables with caption, thead, tbody, and tfoot.
- Media: Embedded images, audio, and video using semantic HTML5 elements.
- Forms: A fully structured form using multiple input types and native HTML5 validation.

## Features
- **HTML5 Validation:** All required inputs use attributes like `required`, `minlength`, `maxlength`, `pattern`, `type`, etc., without JavaScript.
- **Accessibility:** Proper use of labels, fieldsets, legends, and ARIA attributes.
- **Semantic Structure:** Sections, headings, figures, and captions for clarity.
- **Optional Enhancements:** Datalist for suggestions, file upload fields, and color/range inputs.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `enhanced-form.html` in a modern web browser.
3. Test content, media, and form validation interactively.

## Notes
- The form demonstrates native HTML5 validation only; no JavaScript is used.
